LIMIT – Proof of Financial Restraint (Hackathon Demo)

This backend demonstrates how financial discipline can be evaluated
WITHOUT tracking spending rewards.

Flow:
1. Load mock transaction data
2. Apply simple discipline rules:
   - Budget adherence
   - Reduced impulse spending
   - Savings consistency
3. Output a boolean discipline result
4. Convert result into a simulated proof object

No real banking APIs.
No authentication.
No cryptography.

This is a prototype to show SYSTEM DESIGN thinking.
